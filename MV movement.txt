- When AV moves down > the LA should fill by 5mL?
How can this account for 70% of the LSVS?

- Should the beginning of the cycle start with MV open and passive LA or active LA? 




--------- 0d model ----------
- Does the compliance mean the contraction of the ventricles? check filling time in charlie's example - looks counter-intuitive
- How should I calculate the pressure in the MV when the MV is closed?
- The pressure for the ventricle should be what?
- Should use pressure or flow to open/close the MV?
- Is capacitance (ml*s/mmHg) the same as compliance(ml/mmHg)? it seems to have different units -- compliance (acumulates mass) is for physiological circuits 


-------- AV movement --------

> the extension is 3.35 cm tall
> the average velocity of the AV plane movement is 10 cm/s according to Maksuti/piston paper

1- move the MV sideset downwards by 1.6 cm

2- move circle inside the MV extension
LSVS= 100-110ml *0.68 ~ 68ml during ventricular systole 
>> this stroke volume should be calculated using a 0d model


2.5cm in the z direction >> 1.6 cm
2.76cm in radius

pi*2.5^2*z = 59.8 cm^3=59.8ml

pi*1.6^2*z = 59.8 cm^3=38.2ml
