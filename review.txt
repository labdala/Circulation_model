Skagseth 2009 - Pulmonary Vein Flow Pattern in Man During Thoracotomy
- Has PV flow and LA pressure

Scaling data to match 5 l/min

> data2

DOWNSTREAM ------------------------------

Leo Fluid Dynamic Assessment of Three Polymeric Heart Valves Using Particle Image Velocimetry
- Aortic pressure data

Yellin Peskin 1981 - Mechanisms of mitral valve motion during diastole 
 - Has flow and pressure data for doghearts

Peskin 1982 - THE FLUID DYNAMICS OF  HEART VALVES:EXPERIMENTAL, THEORETICAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS 
- Has a review for left hearts and a simplified schematic of data from doghearts. No magnitude in the plots.

Prisco 2016-Impact of LVAD Implantation Site on Ventricular Blood Stagnation
- Has mitral valve flow

peskin (waveform)+Prisco (magnitude) = data for mitral valve flow
peskin (waveform) + Leo (magnitude) = data for aortic valve flow
